## 2. Google Play Store Apps 
The project uses the data to perform data analysis utilizing different tree-based models, covering Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM to identify the accuracy of R2 score for the rating of the App over 10000 mobile apps in the Google Play Store Apps.

Meanwhile, the train test split and cross-validation will be also adopted for model evaluation.

## 3. Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

The project is to investigate the comprehensive data analysis shall be implemented in order to understand the capability, price, categories (Japanese food restaurant or sushi restaurant) and rating for the Japanese Restaurant in New York City.
