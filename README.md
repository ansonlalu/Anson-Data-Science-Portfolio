## 1. Household Electric Power Consumption by LSTM 
This work is to predict the Household Electric Power Consumption by using LSTM. The features are used to forecast the active power used in the future and listed below.

&emsp;&emsp; 1. Active Power <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 2. Reactive Power <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 3. Voltage <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 4. Global_intensity <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 5. Sub_metering_1 <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 6. Sub_metering_2 <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 7. Sub_metering_3 <br/>

The result is briefly listed, loss: 0.0103,  val_loss: 0.0088

## 2. Prediction of Stock Price using LSTM
This is my preliminary work is to predict the stock price of Nvidia by using LSTM. Different features gathered from Yahoo Finance, covering: 

&emsp;&emsp; 1. Open Price                 <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 2. High Price                 <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 3. Low Price                  <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 4. Volume                     <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 5. Close Price                <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 6. Closing Price of UPP       <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 7. Closing Price of GDX       <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 8. Closing Price of QQQ       <br/>

Those are used for the prediction of the closing price. The work will be amended from time to time for better accuracy.

## 3. Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction- Best Score: 0.87735 for XG Boost
This work is to predict customers whether they are really interested in the new product of Vehicle Insurance provided by the client of Insurance Company in this project. This project includes the topic commonly appear in data science, covering: <br/>

&emsp;&emsp; 1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (Count Plot, Distribution Plot, Correlation Matrix, etc.) <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 2.	The Use of Random Forest Classifier <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 3.	The Use of Feature Importance <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 4.	The Use of Randomized Search for Random Forest <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 5.	The Use of Randomized Search for XG Boost <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 6.	Reference <br/>

## 4. Google Play Store Apps 
The project uses the data to perform data analysis utilizing different tree-based models, covering Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM to identify the accuracy of R2 score for the rating of the App over 10000 mobile apps in the Google Play Store Apps.

Meanwhile, the train test split and cross-validation will be also adopted for model evaluation.

## 5. Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

The project is to investigate the comprehensive data analysis shall be implemented in order to understand the capability, price, categories (Japanese food restaurant or sushi restaurant) and rating for the Japanese Restaurant in New York City. The assessment can help understand what business strategy of Japanese restaurant shall be made (e.g. pricing strategy, decision for the acquisition of higher rating, location, etc.) before its new launch.
